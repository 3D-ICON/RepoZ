# RepoZ

RepoZ is a small tool to help you keeping track of local Git repositories on your development machine.

It simply provides a quick overview of your repositories including some shortcuts like opening a command line tool and checking out Git branches, etc.

As an extra goodie for Windows users, RepoZ automatically detects open File Explorer windows and adds a status appendix to their title if they are in context of a Git repository.

> This tool is heavily inspired by the awesome PowerShell extension [posh-git](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git). Give it a try if you are using Git with PowerShell.

> Check their [Status Summary topic](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git#git-status-summary-information) for more information about the compact status appendix.

Use at your own risk, have fun!
